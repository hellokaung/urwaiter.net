## ✨ What is Your Waiter?

Your Waiter allows customers to open a restaurant menu online using a QR code or link, browse items comfortably, save what they want, and show the list directly to the waiter or use it for pickup/delivery orders.

It focuses on simplicity, speed, and reducing confusion — especially in places with language barriers.
